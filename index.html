            <h2>Plagiarism Detection App</h2>
            <h3><i class="fa-brands fa-node-js"></i><i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i></h3>
            <p>This project was completed over a 4 month period from February 2023 to May 2023. The work was done together in a team of 6. The inspiration for this project was
                that a Computer Science professor at the local community college wanted to crack down on code sharing and cheating among his students, so he asked our team to build him
                an application that would be able to detect signs of plagiarism, as well as discourage students from cheating. The final product that we presented to him was a fully functioning Node.JS application that had numerous anti-cheating 
                features built-in. These features included:
                <li>A web scraper that searches the web for specific exam/homework questions that may have been posted without the consent of the original author on websites like Chegg</li>
                <li>A document reader that works in tandem with the web scraper. It parses these files for homework/exam questions, which are then searched on the web by the web scraper.</li>
                <li>A Similarity Checker that compared student code and assigned a score based on how similar one student's code was to another</li>

                and I'm happy that my contributions got accepted. The right to vote is sacred in this country, so I'm glad that I got to be a part of something that encourages people to exercise

                This project was completed as part of a 2 month internship for Codeday Labs during the summer of 2021. I along with 2 others worked together to build a web application that 
                allowed the user to both measure as well as improve their typing speed. The user would get 1 minute to type a randomly generated paragraph, and then when time was up
                they'd get their wpm (words-per-minute) as well as a count of how many mistakes they made during the attempt. The user could then opt to retake the test again for as many times
                as they liked in order to improve their wpm. The application generated a paragraph through the use of an api, and we used the React and NodeJS frameworks to build the app.

            <h2>Election Data Aggregation Applications</h2>
            <h3><i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i></h3>
            <p>
                Over the years I've made numerous mini applications that help aggregate and clean up election and census data from all across the USA. All of these application were
                coded in Python and utilized the pandas data science library. Some of these applications are:
                <ul>
                    <li>California voting precinct to census block conversion:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Converts Califronia precinct data to census blocks, making it easier to analyze as well as see electoral changes over the years</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>US Census data aggregated by congressional district:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aggregates the data provided by the US Census department by the congressional districts that are currently in use for the 118th congress. The data created a demographic profile
                                of the residents living in these districts which included information pertaining to race,
                                median household income, and percentage of adults over the age of 25 with a college degree.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Michigan precinct data aggregated by municipality:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aggregates the voting precinct election data provided by the Michigan Secretary of State by municipality. This made the data more user friendly and readable, as well
                                as made it such that it would be easier to analyze electoral changes over the years. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                This application was built during the 2019 CSUMB Startup Hackathon. Over the course of 3 days, my team and I built an application that would help streamline the
                city of Salinas' tree cutting request form. While this project wasn't anything flashy, it did improve the way the city handled tree cutting requests. Before you would have 
                to submit a paper form to city hall, which is inconvenient and cumbersome. Our app streamlined the process by making it online. Now if you wanted a tree removed all you had to 
                do was submit an online form.

                This application was built during the summer of 2019 while I was taking part of Google's Computer Science Summer Institute. I along with a team of 4 others 
                built a website that allowed the user to search up any videogame and find the review scores for it. The website used the Metacritic API when searching for review scores.
